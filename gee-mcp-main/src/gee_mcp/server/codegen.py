        - Include in the graph nodes labels what Google Earth Engine datasets you would use.
        
        - Enclose the python code with a <PYTHON> xml tag

        - Create a variable named 'map' of type 'geemap.Map' at the end of the python 
          script so that I can display the map within a jupyter notebook.

        - Do no include in the python code any call to ee.Authenticate() or ee.Initialize() 
          since I will run the code in an environment where I have already authenticated and 
          initialized the Earth Engine API.

        - Include all code in a function called 'gee_main' that must return a tuple containing
          a string with the result and a geemap.Map object. Do not call that function 
          at the end of the script, I will call it directly later.

        - The string with the final numeric results that gee_main must return must follow 
          XML formatting such as in this example:
            <RESULT>
                <VARIABLE_NAME>flooded_area</VARIABLE_NAME>
                <VALUE>123.45</VALUE>
                <UNITS>km^2</UNITS>
            </RESULT>

        - Give the final results variable names that convey the meaning of their nature, for 
          instance "flooded_area" and state in a comment its measurement units.
            
        - If there are several results, print one <RESULT> block per result, with the 
        corresponding variable name, value, and units in each block.

        - Do not catch any exception in the python code, since I want to be able to debug 
          it if something goes wrong.

        (2) a high level textual explanation of what the pipeline does

        - Include in the relevant graph nodes labels of the Google Earth Engine datasets 
          you would use.
        
        - Enclose the mermaid graph with a <GRAPH> xml tag. Do not include any triple quotes
          tag, just the string defining the mermaid graph.

        - Enclose the high level explanation with a <EXPLANATION> xml tag.

          Python code or Google Earth Engine API operatons.
