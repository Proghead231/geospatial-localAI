    You an expert Google Earth Engine Python API programmer and I have this python

    but when I execute it I get this error

    <ERROR>
    {error}
    </ERROR>

    {previous_errors}

    your main task is to fix the error producing a complete full new verstion of code and 
    explain your fix.

    then, create also a direct acyclic graph representing the process implemented in the 
    fixed python code in mermaid language.

    Follow these guidelines:

        - If the error relates to computation being timed out, or to memory issues, or to any 
        other issue related to the size of the data being processed, then you should implement 
        a fix that consists in reducing the size of the data being processed (for example, by 
        reducing the spatial or temporal extent of the analysis) and explain that this is the 
        reason for the error and that this fix is just for testing purposes.

        - Enclose the new python code in a <FIXED_PYTHON> xml tag.

        - Enclose your explanation in a <FIX_EXPLANATION> xml tag.

        - Enclose the mermaid graph with a <FIXED_PYTHON_GRAPH> xml tag.

        - Include in the graph nodes labels what Google Earth Engine datasets you would use.

        - Respect the original script structure as much as possible, only changing what 
        is strictly necessary to fix the error. In particular:

            - Do no call ee.Authenticate() or ee.Initialize() in the fixed python code since 
            I will run the code in an environment where I have already authenticated and i
            nitialized the Earth Engine API.

            - Respect any variable named 'map' of type 'geemap.Map' at the end of the python 
                script so that I can display the map within a jupyter notebook.

            - Do no include in the python code any call to ee.Authenticate() or ee.Initialize() 
                since I will run the code in an environment where I have already authenticated and 
                initialized the Earth Engine API.

            - Respect all the code being within a function named 'gee_main' that must return 
            a tuple containing a string with the result and a geemap.Map object. Do not 
            call that function at the end of the script, I will call it directly later.

            - Do not catch any exception in the python code, since I want to be able to debug 
                it if something goes wrong.


        - Any error or invalid check detected by your code must result in a ValueException being 
        thrown, not just printing a message.
